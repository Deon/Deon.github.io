                                    <p>Hi there! I'm Deon, a first-year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
                                        Since grade 10, I've been really passionate about computer science and took several courses in CS or technology-oriented fields.
                                        I've done a good amount of Python and Java native development in the past, but now I'm working on mobile-focused web development.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Alongside CS, I'm really passionate about technology and films. I'm the Editor-in-Chief at Blank's Media Network (look down a bit)!
                                        When I'm not working away at one project or another, you can usually find me watching (or reviewing) a movie -
                                        I'm a big fan of animated films, notably <em>WALL-E</em> and <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>.

                                [blank]'s Universe, which later evolved into a media network with a YouTube channel, and a sister site where we would publish film reviews!
